Honestly, I had very little knowledge about People In The Box until their latest _Kodomo Rengou_, which was released in February 2018. I was relatively new to today's Japanese rock music 'cuz I was crazy in dance music since the late '00s. However, one of my friends strongly recommended the album, saying that it would be the album of the year. Then I tried listening and soon fell in love with it. I've listened to it over and over, even ignoring other new releases.

The album reminded me of some math-rock acts but it had a more physical and active groove. Rather than indulging in sweet and violent tones from the amplifiers, just as some bands do (oops, I don't blame on them. just for comparison), they play riffs and rhythm patterns with strong clarity. From a note to note, I can hear their intention--how they want them to sound, how they want them to be. The interplay between melodies is dizzying yet compelling me to dance to it. I dare say that it's like something fusing prog-rock, chamber music and afrobeat.

Their lyrics are also important. With quite simple vocabulary, they often depict the ordinary life around us, especially in Japan's suburbs. Let me take "町A (Town A)" as an example. In its chorus, Hirofumi Hatano (Vo. & Guitar, who also writes all of their lyrics) sings like this: "huge mall, restaurant, public library, udon noodle stand, book store, bakery, housing, flower shop, ramen stand, shrine, temple, secondhand car shop, room with sunlight." Most Japanese people may easily imagine such a tasteless landscape. It belongs nowhere, as the title suggests. It has no name. If anything, it can be everywhere. It might be my hometown, or else, someone's hometown instead.

"This is not heaven, let alone a paradise. / However, this is not hell even. / One night after another / Say, a buffer zone or resting place between nights / This is not heaven; just my hometown" Hatano sings. Ok, this is certainly the mise-en-scene of our everyday life. But how strange, weird, and uncanny is this? It's like the Brechtian theatre's distancing effect. It's pretty ambivalent that the album closes with a song named "僕は正気 (I AM sane)". Are we still sober or losing our minds in this world?

Hatano deliberately manipulates words and depicts people's inherent anxiety without any sentimental rhetorics. But it moves my mind so hard that I almost cry when I listen to "かみさま (God)" and "僕は正気".

The tight groove of the ensemble, the complicated texture of the sound, and the lyrics' peculiar poesy. This is obviously the best Japanese rock album of 2018.
