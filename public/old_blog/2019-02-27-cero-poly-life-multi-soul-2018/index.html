<p>Throughout the 2010s, Japanese pop music has been obsessed with the so-called &lsquo;urban&rsquo; or &lsquo;city&rsquo; feeling. Many bands tried to render their impressions on their own city life, mostly in Tokyo. They sounded more optimistic than how the society actually was, but I think it was kinda redevelopment of their imaginary city. After the great earthquake in 2011, this act of redevelopment became more crucial since the city&ndash;well, of course, Tokyo&ndash;was heavily damaged both literally and psychologically. They needed to fix it, at least imaginarily.</p>
<p>In my opinion, cero&rsquo;s body of work is a good example of this zeitgeist. The band was originally formed by three multi-instrumentalists, Shohei Takagi, Yu Arauchi, and Tomoyuki Yanagi in 2004. Around 2006 Tsubasa Hashimoto joined them. They released their debut full-length in 2011 but Yanagi left the band. Now cero consists of Takagi, Arauchi, and Hashimoto along with a bunch of skillful fellow musicians supporting them.</p>

      ></iframe>
    </div>

<p>Their early works like <em>WORLD RECORD</em> and <em>My Lost City</em> were a very playful and fantastic depiction of the contemporary city and suburban life. Influenced by classic Japanese rock bands such as はっぴいえんど, they played psychedelic folk-rock songs with comtemporary twists that could be compared to early Beck, but with a more exotic flavor.</p>


    
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iyIaweKZvcM?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

<p>However, after these two records, they began exploring a different direction. Their EP <em>Yellow Magus</em> released in 2013 was comprised of four songs apparently inspired by deep funk tunes from the 70s. Two years later, they released their third album <em>Obscure Ride</em>. It was heavily influenced by neo-soul and contemporary jazz, particularly D&rsquo;Angelo&rsquo;s <em>Voodoo</em> or the Soulquarians&rsquo; other works.</p>


    
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lfETQNfBAD4?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

<p>Since then, their main interest has been rhythm and groove. Listening to <em>Obscure Ride</em>, you can imagine they roam around the imaginary city and its suburbs on the loose, out-of-pocket 16-beat with bittersweet R&amp;B feelings. It fascinated some audience in Japan and led the band one of the most prominent acts in Tokyo.</p>


    
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ouef18CtxFU?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

<p>And <em>POLY LIFE MULTI SOUL</em> was released in 2018. As soon as its lead single &ldquo;魚の骨 鳥の羽根&rdquo; uploaded on YouTube, it made a sensation. As you can hear, it features 3:4 cross-rhythm entirely. Moreover, the other songs also feature polyrhythm, irregular meters, metric modulations.</p>
<p>Although their rhythmic structure is rather complex, this album is quite danceable. It ends with a song named &ldquo;Poly Life Multi Soul,&rdquo; which has a strong four-on-the-floor beat in the second half. This ending sequence reminds me of feeling right before the party&rsquo;s over. Delightfully tired, getting ready to start another day under the sun.</p>


    
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="eager" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/at6iJ0ul2XA?autoplay=0&controls=1&end=0&loop=0&mute=0&start=0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" title="YouTube video"
      ></iframe>
    </div>

<p>In terms of lyrics, it seemed influenced by American and South American literature. In fact, &ldquo;夜になると鮭は&rdquo; directly adapts Raymond Carver&rsquo;s poem. Here, the surrealistic nature of contemporary city life was connected with the magical realism by the lyricist and vocalist, Takagi. Feeling haunted by anonymous lives and straying souls, we&rsquo;re trying to deal with everyday life.</p>
<p>Far from the city as an idealized utopia, <em>POLY LIFE MULTI SOUL</em> arrived at somewhere both magical and uncanny. And this actually was the Japanese city life in 2018, I think.</p>
