Enuma Fumiya&rsquo;s #1 is his first full-length as a solo singer-songwriter. After the break-up of plenty in 2017, the introspective frontman of the band took some synths and a daw into his hands instead of the guitar. While plenty&rsquo;s music was characterized by the shoegaze-like guitar noise with catchy melodies&ndash;say, very &ldquo;indie&rdquo; in a sense&ndash;the album was completely rid of such catharsis. It was like something between psychedelic folk and alternative r&amp;b which could be compared to James Blake&rsquo;s or Frank Ocean&rsquo;s seminal works. I would say that he was finding another way to express his thought with a great delicacy. And he actually did it." />

<p>Enuma Fumiya&rsquo;s <em>#1</em> is his first full-length as a solo singer-songwriter. After the break-up of plenty in 2017, the introspective frontman of the band took some synths and a daw into his hands instead of the guitar. While plenty&rsquo;s music was characterized by the shoegaze-like guitar noise with catchy melodies&ndash;say, very &ldquo;indie&rdquo; in a sense&ndash;the album was completely rid of such catharsis. It was like something between psychedelic folk and alternative r&amp;b which could be compared to James Blake&rsquo;s or Frank Ocean&rsquo;s seminal works. I would say that he was finding another way to express his thought with a great delicacy. And he actually did it.</p>

<p>In the endless reverberation and infinite echoes, his voice tells us how he&rsquo;s sad and desperate. This sadness once used to be quite dramatic and ecstatic especially when he was with his band, but now it&rsquo;s more nuanced as he elaborates the sound design. Every sound of the album is deliberately modulated to express feelings that couldn&rsquo;t be said with words. M9 &ldquo;take my hands&rdquo; is the best example I think. The guitar loop is granulated and pitch-shifted voices are haunting the entire song. The song sounds like memories suspended in the air, slowly falling into oblivion.</p>
<p>From this March, Enuma has released three singles which would be featured in the new album. These three songs, &ldquo;うるせえんだよ&rdquo;, &ldquo;偽善からはじめよう&rdquo;, and &ldquo;積み木くずし&rdquo; are more friendly in sound but much more pessimistic in words. FYI &ldquo;うるせえんだよ&rdquo; and &ldquo;偽善からはじめよう&rdquo; can be respectively translated like &ldquo;Shut the fuck up&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin with hypocrisy&rdquo;, both are very shocking as song&rsquo;s name. However, while he sings about his distrust of the people and the impossibility of mutual understanding, he is also breaking the walls of creativity.</p>

<p>Enuma recently plays his show with a young and mysterious band 木 (ki), one of the most anticipated new comer in Japan. Among music lovers, they&rsquo;re known for an eccentric and minimalistic approach with a definite pop sense. Their avant-garde pop rendered in a smooth R&amp;B flavor, which is 木&rsquo;s signature style, certainly resonates with Enuma&rsquo;s solo works (check out the band&rsquo;s debut EP <em>Vi</em> below). This collaboration is pretty fascinating to me. I&rsquo;d like to watch their show someday this year.</p>
