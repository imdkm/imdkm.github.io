When I found that RM (from BTS) was listening to Tempalay&rsquo;s &ldquo;どうしよう (dooshiyou)&rdquo; I was very excited since it was one of my most favorite songs then. The song starts with slightly out-of-scale riffs which have a dislocating feeling. After a sudden glitchy edit, the band&rsquo;s vocalist Ryoto Obara begins to sing with the mesmerizing guitar and the bold beat, embraced by their multi-instrumentalist AAAMYYY&rsquo;s backing chorus. I was not satisfied with the cheesy vid but I couldn&rsquo;t help watching it over and over and over. I thought RM might feel the same way as me." />

<p>Tempalay is a Japanese psychedelic rock band, whose music apparently resonates with the Aussie star band Tame Impala (oh, their names resembles each other btw). Raw, lo-fi, and strangely chill. Listening to them is like a lucid dream or a psychedelic trip without losing minds. The band was formed in 2014 and officially debuted in 2015 by the EP Instant Hawaii. It took only two years to take &rsquo;em Austin, Texas to play at SXSW 2016. They&rsquo;ve been so prolific that they&rsquo;ve released three EPs and two full-length from 2015 to 2018, even they&rsquo;re gonna release their third full-length 21世紀より愛をこめて (can be translated like <em>From 21st century with love</em>) this June.</p>
<p>なんて素晴らしき世界 <em>(Nante Subarashiki Sekai,</em> which means <em>What a wonderful world)</em> is their third EP which includes &ldquo;どうしよう&rdquo; the single mentioned above. As the original bass player Yuya Takeuchi left the band in 2018, the former support player AAAMYYY, who&rsquo;s also known for her solo career as a beatmaker officially joined in. Since she was not a proper bass player (she mostly play samplers and synths) welcoming her in the band led them a more eclectic sound, featuring a variety of instruments and electronics. For example, &ldquo;テレパシー (Telepathy)&rdquo; has 808 in its verse, popping electronic sound effects in the chorus, and AAAMYYY&rsquo;s rap is also featured in the bridge.</p>

<p>Moreover, you may hear more elaborate and tricky songwriting in songs like &ldquo;SONIC WAVE&rdquo;, which has a lot of sudden scene changes, or &ldquo;Last Dance&rdquo;, which heavily features metric modulations. Yes. The ensemble is pretty tight. The songs are well-written and playful. I bet their upcoming 21世紀より愛をこめて is gonna be their true breakthrough. Fortunately, they just released a single called &ldquo;のめりこめ、震えろ。(Nomerikome, furuero.)&rdquo;, roughly translated like &ldquo;Lose yourself and shiver&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll listen to it and lose myself as they ask me to do.</p>
