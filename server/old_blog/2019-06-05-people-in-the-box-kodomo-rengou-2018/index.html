  <p>Honestly, I had very little knowledge about People In The Box until their latest <em>Kodomo Rengou</em>, which was released in February 2018. I was relatively new to today&rsquo;s Japanese rock music &lsquo;cuz I was crazy in dance music since the late &rsquo;00s. However, one of my friends strongly recommended the album, saying that it would be the album of the year. Then I tried listening and soon fell in love with it. I&rsquo;ve listened to it over and over, even ignoring other new releases.</p>
<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1nHBkhIYzUGoZsapNNS69z" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>?si=V-zpdA0zQaCYh4CeI-QLtA
<p>The album reminded me of some math-rock acts but it had a more physical and active groove. Rather than indulging in sweet and violent tones from the amplifiers, just as some bands do (oops, I don&rsquo;t blame on them. just for comparison), they play riffs and rhythm patterns with strong clarity. From a note to note, I can hear their intention&ndash;how they want them to sound, how they want them to be. The interplay between melodies is dizzying yet compelling me to dance to it. I dare say that it&rsquo;s like something fusing prog-rock, chamber music and afrobeat.</p>
<p>Their lyrics are also important. With quite simple vocabulary, they often depict the ordinary life around us, especially in Japan&rsquo;s suburbs. Let me take &ldquo;町A (Town A)&rdquo; as an example. In its chorus, Hirofumi Hatano (Vo. &amp; Guitar, who also writes all of their lyrics) sings like this: &ldquo;huge mall, restaurant, public library, udon noodle stand, book store, bakery, housing, flower shop, ramen stand, shrine, temple, secondhand car shop, room with sunlight.&rdquo; Most Japanese people may easily imagine such a tasteless landscape. It belongs nowhere, as the title suggests. It has no name. If anything, it can be everywhere. It might be my hometown, or else, someone&rsquo;s hometown instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not heaven, let alone a paradise. / However, this is not hell even. / One night after another / Say, a buffer zone or resting place between nights / This is not heaven; just my hometown&rdquo; Hatano sings. Ok, this is certainly the mise-en-scene of our everyday life. But how strange, weird, and uncanny is this? It&rsquo;s like the Brechtian theatre&rsquo;s distancing effect. It&rsquo;s pretty ambivalent that the album closes with a song named &ldquo;僕は正気 (I AM sane)&rdquo;. Are we still sober or losing our minds in this world?</p>
<p>Hatano deliberately manipulates words and depicts people&rsquo;s inherent anxiety without any sentimental rhetorics. But it moves my mind so hard that I almost cry when I listen to &ldquo;かみさま (God)&rdquo; and &ldquo;僕は正気&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The tight groove of the ensemble, the complicated texture of the sound, and the lyrics&rsquo; peculiar poesy. This is obviously the best Japanese rock album of 2018.</p>
